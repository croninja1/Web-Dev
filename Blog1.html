        <p>This week we dove into the beginnings of HTML code. I learned that HTML is the language that<br> 
            most websites are written in. This was my first real encounter with HTML so I looked at a few<br> 
            HTML for beginners websites such as html.com which had a very simple run down on starting <br>
            with HTML and CSS and how they work. The article started off explaining what tags and <br>
            attributes are and how they are the basis of HTML. Essentially it taught me that tags, such as <br>
            the h1 tag, are the mark up and start of HTML elements whereas attributes are similar to <br>
            tags but have more information within them to do certain things. It then goes in depth and <br>
            shows how to do things such as add links, images, tables, and lists to the website to make it <br>
            more organized. 
        </p>

            After reading this article I could do the labs from class more easily and write html code more <br>
            fluently. I am now much better at setting up the layout such as:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <xmp>
                <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html>
	                <head>
		                <title></title>
	                </head>
	                <body>
		                <h1></h1>
		                <p></p>
	                </body>
                </html>

                </xmp>
        </pre>
        <p>
            This is the simple layout where the doctype specifies what language the page would be written<br>
            on, the head tag starts the header with the title within it, and then the body proceeds with the <br>
            main writing within it. Overall, the article did teach me all of the basics that I needed to get a <br>
            good head start on html. HTML is cool to me because you can immediately see what you have done <br>
            to the web page. It seems like it would be very useful in the real world as everything is online now a days.
