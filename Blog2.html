                In week 2 we focused much more on the CSS portion of code which helps more with the <br>
            visual aspect of the webpage. CSS is important because you use it to make a website more <br>
            appealing rather than just a white screen with black text. I decided to research more into CSS <br>
            and what all can be done with it. I started by looking at a w3schools page that showed the <br>
            different ways to style html using CSS. I first learned that there are 3 different ways include CSS<br>
            to html. The first is inline where you use a style attribute such as <xmp><h1 style =”color: green;”> This heading is green</h1> </xmp>The second is Internal where you add a tyle element in the head <br>
            attribute at the top, and the third is external where you create a CSS file and then link that within the <br>
            html file. All of these are good options depending on what you are trying to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            After going over the basics such as changing the background/text color, changing the <br>
            font, and adding borders, I wanted to go more in depth and learn about some more complex <br>
            topics. I read an article about web style sheets and learned many new selectors and CSS <br>
            code styles that could come in handy. One that was very interesting was the way you could <br>
            style images and other figures with captions. You would do this using the figure tag in html <br>
            and then using CSS can position where the text is, how big the image is, the margins of the <br>
            image and the padding. An example of the CSS code for a figure would look something like this:
        </p>

        <xmp>
            Figure {
                Width: 30%;
	        Text-align: center;
	        Border: solid;
	        Margin: 0.5em;
	        Padding: 0.5em;
            }
        </xmp>

        <p>
            This would have the image filling almost the entire box with the caption centered perfectly <br>
            under it. This would be very helpful when making a website because every good website has a <br>
            good use of images. When you have your images formatted well, your website looks much more visually <br>
            appealing and more professional.
