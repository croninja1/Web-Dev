    <p>After learning last week about using CSS to add some style to our html files, we jumped into focusing more on the layout of the page this week. We dove into Flexbox which essentially creates a box like shape called a container that helps you better space things out and layout everything the way you would like. After learning about flexbox, I realized that it can be a very complex concept because there is so much you can do with it. The following shows the main idea of flexbox:</p>

    <p>If you look at this figure, The darker shade of grey is the overall container. The cross axis is always perpendicular to the main axis but is not always in the same direction. You can control many properties for the container such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Direction it is laid out in by changing flex-direction</li>
        <li>The way the items wrap when they reach the end by using flex-wrap</li>
        <li>The spacing and alignment between objects within the container by using justify-content </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Properties for the flex children can also be edited in flexbox such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The size of the child items</li>
        <li>The order of the child items</li>
        <li>The exact alignment of the child items</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Flexbox is one of the harder concepts for html but is extremely helpful for webpages. Next week I will look deeper into flexbox to learn the different positionings and exact ways to edit these properties of boxes.</p>
