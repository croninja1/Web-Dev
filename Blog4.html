    <p>In today’s world, there are many different screen sizes and devices that can access the same web. There are laptops, computers, tablets, and smart phones in many households that are used to surf the web. Web Developers must adhere to that and assure that their websites can be easily navigated and read from any screen. The first way to do this is by adding a viewport meta. Outside of that, media queries are a great way to have your website be the best that it can be for any screen. A media query would look something like this:</p>

    <p>A media rule itself works as a logical operator basically like an if statement where it checks if the type and features match, do what it is told to do, otherwise don’t. When a media query is set up, a website is so much easier to use on the phone. Instead of scrolling all over and trying to press the links meant for a laptop, you can set it up where the links pop up from a column button rather than just being laid out across the screen. Overall, media queries are a must for any web developers as it doesn’t narrow down the target market and anyone can access the website whatever way they want. This is huge in today’s society. </p>
