    <p>If I were to be teaching CS347 in the Spring of 2022, I would change a few things. In general, I would keep the structure of having a lab every class but would have <br>
        the students finish the lab after class. The beginnig of class I would clarify the harder aspects of the reading and then have students start on the lab. <br>
    I would also change the layout of the course so that the focus is more on the javascript and react portion. I would speed up and combine some of the html and css <br>
    labs because that stuff in general for a computer science student is easier to learn/understand. I would want to start on the javascript part much earlier in the semester <br>
    so that my students feel comfortable with javascript and react when they finish the course. For the javascript stuff, I would more go and teach exactly the layout of javascript <br>
    so that students understand more of what everything does rather than just copy and pasting stuff from the textbook. The textbook as a whole was very very helpful <br>
    and helped me learn a lot, but when it comes to the javascript stuff I would like to understand more of the dispatch and useState and all those more complicated things. <br>
    I believe it is smart to not test in this course because of how everything is hands on. The Projects also are the biggest point of learning the content as it is much more <br>
    open ended and makes you actually have to look stuff up more and learn more about how to do the things you want to do.</p>

    <p>Overall, this is a great course and I learned a great deal from it. I think if it was structured the same but dlew threw the html/css stuff the way it does for the <br>
    javascript stuff and slowed down on the javascript content it would be much better and would be one of if not my favorite CS class so far. I think many students are interested <br>
    in the web design and devolpment section of CS so this is a great course to take.</p>
